Simple Inventory Management

This project aims to be a simple, end-user friendly Inventory Management system. Other open source options tend to be large projects aimed for administrators for usually large companies.

The goal of this project is simple: have three primary menus that access a small database. The goal is that it can be run on a single machine and be a 3-click navigation.

1. Select the item
2. Enter how many of the item is being removed
3. Press return to save the new quantity

The primary UX is inspired by a program called Optiflex.

As of 6/1/2024 (or 1/6/2024 for non-Americans), the project has a semi-functional TUI system, but the goal is to have a GUI based on PyQt6 in the future.
